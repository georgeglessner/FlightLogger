# FlightLogger

Store unique flights per day from dump1090 as a CSV file. 

## Usage

Before you can successfully run `FlightLogger.py` you will need to create a file called `config.py`. The file should be formatted as such:

```
IP_ADDR = 'Host IP Address'
```

The best use of this script would be to run it as a cron job or something similar.
